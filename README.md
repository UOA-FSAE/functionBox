# description
Where all the functions are gonna be stored

# Usage
Put all tests in the tests.py folder, they will be run on push and uploaded to the latest workflow run of python-test.yml as an artifact
Put functions in the source folder, under their own folder if required.  

# Caveats
Requirements currently stored in the setup.py file, I plan to move them later.
